UNO™ & Friends: Fast Fun for Everyone!
UNO™, the world's most beloved card game, introduces a new free social experience!

UNO and Friends is a mobile video game developed in Gameloft Toronto. I have been working on this game as producer, lead producer and game manager since the very 1st prototype in 2011 until the very last update in 2017.

Game Managers at Gameloft are in charge of handling all aspects of a game at Gameloft. They are responsible for initiating programs, following their progress, and serving as support providers in case issues arise. They coordinate efforts among workers and outside partners, as well as develop effective schedules and suggest action items that still need to be complete to successfully complete the project.
In addition to these tasks, Game Managers track technical issues and implement solutions in a prompt manner. They must effectively communicate project status and suggest changes to use company resources more efficiently. Game Managers provide expertise for escalated quality problems, and anticipate bottlenecks in the development cycle. Additionally, they define strategies, regularly participate in executive meetings to present their progress, and share project information with other Game Managers in the company.
