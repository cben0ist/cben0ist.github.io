Direct-Energie has been one of the 1st company created during the opening of the electricity and naural gaz market in France, to the competitors, in 2004.

I have been working at Direct-Energie, Paris, France from 2005 to 2011. I was still a student, working to get my Master Degree in Computer Science when Direct-Energie hired me as a Java dveloper. I had the chance to grow along with this company and took the lead on some specific developments and for the technical migration to SAP in 2009. I then spent the next 2 years as a Technical Project Manager, using agile methodologies, to make that link between the business and the development teams and making sure the application on my portfolio was getting the necessary update, always on time.
