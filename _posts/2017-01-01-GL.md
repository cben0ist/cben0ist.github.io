**Game Manager**, Since Dec 2016
<br>Game Managers at Gameloft are in charge of handling all aspects of a game at Gameloft. They are responsible for initiating programs, following their progress, and serving as support providers in case issues arise. They coordinate efforts among workers and outside partners, as well as develop effective schedules and suggest action items that still need to be complete to successfully complete the project.
