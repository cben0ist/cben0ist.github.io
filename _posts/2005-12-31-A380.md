I had the great opportunity to work on the A380 while it was only a project on paper. Labinal is manufacturing wiring configuration for many Airbus and Boeing airplanes models.
I have been assigned to the new wiring configuration application at Labinal, as a Java developer, working with the remote Business Unit in Hamburg, Germany. This application based on Websphere web servers and AS400 databases assisted the designers to handle complex wiring drawings and relations for each airplane produced.
